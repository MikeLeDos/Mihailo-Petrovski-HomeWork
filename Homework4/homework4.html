            Jordan played college baskeball for three seasons under coach Dean Smith with the North Carolina Tar Heels.
            As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels'national championship team in 1982. Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984
            as the third overall draft pick, and quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring 
            while gaining a reputation as one of the game's best defensive players. His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing
            slam dunks from the free-throw line in Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames "Air Jordan" and "His Airness". 
            Jordan won his first NBA title with the Bulls in 1991, and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing
            a three-peat. Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the 1993-1994 NBA season to play Minor League Baseball but 
            returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three more championships in 1996,1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 
            72 regular season wins in the 1995-96 NBA season.
