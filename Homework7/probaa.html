              >Michael Jeffrey Jordan (born February,17,1963),also know by his
              initial MJ, is anAmerican businessman and former professional
              basketball player. His biography on the official NBA website
              states:"By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest baskteball
              player of all time". He played fifteen seasons in the National
              Basketball Association(NBA), winning six NBA championships with
              the Chicago Bulls. Jordan is the principal owner and chairman of
              the Charlotte Hornets of the NBA and of 23XI Racing in the NASCAR
              Cup Series. He was integral in popularizing the NBA around the
              world in the 1980s and 1990s, becoming a global cultural icon in
              the process. Jordan played college baskeball for three seasons
              under coach Dean Smith with the North Carolina Tar Heels. As a
              freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels'national championship
              team in 1982. Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as the third overall
              draft pick, and quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining
              crowds with his prolific scoring while gaining a reputation as one
              of the game's best defensive players.

            His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the
            free-throw line in Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames "Air
            Jordan" and "His Airness". Jordan won his first NBA title with the
            Bulls in 1991, and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and
            1993, securing a three-peat. Jordan abruptly retired from basketball
            before the 1993-1994 NBA season to play Minor League Baseball but
            returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three more
            championships in 1996,1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72
            regular season wins in the 1995-96 NBA season.
